RFID Assignment Page â€“ README
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The RFID Assignment Page is a React-based frontend interface designed for school or institutional administrators to efficiently assign unique RFID cards to students. The workflow is optimized for bulk scanning: once a class, section, and academic session are selected, the user clicks "Search Students" to load the relevant student list. The RFID input field is automatically focused, enabling seamless card scanning. Each scanned RFID is automatically assigned to the next unassigned student in serial order (by roll number). The system prevents duplicate assignmentsâ€”if an RFID is already in use, the scan is rejected with an error. Manual overrides (search, selection, removal) are also supported for flexibility.

ðŸ§© Frontend Requirements Summary
Initial Load
Fetch
/classes
,
/sections
,
/sessions
Student Load
Only after user selects all 3 filters + clicks
Search
Auto-Assign
On RFID input (debounced), assign to next unassigned student
Duplicate Guard
Block assignment if RFID already exists in current student list
Manual Actions
Search by name/roll/adm, double-click to select, remove RFID
Error Handling
Show toast for network errors, validation failures

ðŸ’¡ Note: The frontend currently uses client-side filtering for "Assigned"/"Unassigned" views. For large datasets, consider moving this to the backend.
